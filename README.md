<h1>TestYourKnowledge</h1>
TestYourKnowledge is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to help users test their knowledge on medical-related topics, such as those encountered in the NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) exam. The app fetches multiple-choice medical questions from an API and allows users to navigate through them. It records the answers, calculates a final score based on the NEET marking scheme (+4 for correct answers, -1 for incorrect answers, and 0 for unanswered questions), and provides a detailed result at the end of the quiz.
